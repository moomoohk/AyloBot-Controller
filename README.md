JillBot-Controller
==================

Control ayloJill's Twitch Bot!

This app gives you the ability to use buttons to control the bot so you don't have to type them out over and over again. Great if you are lazy/most fingers are broken.

[Download](https://github.com/moomoohk/JillBot-Controller/releases/latest)

(Requires Java 1.6)

If you see me on the stream be sure to tell me what you think! All feedback is appreciated.
